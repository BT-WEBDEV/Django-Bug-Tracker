# Django-Bug-Tracker

READ FIRST: This project is a "ticket tracker" or "bug tracker" used for either software or web development. This is an example of a "CRUD" application. 

VIEW LIVE PROJECT HERE: https://bt-bug-tracker.herokuapp.com/

This project lets the user: 
1 - Create a profile to view, submit, delete, edit, and 'mark as complete' different tickets that have been submitted. 
2 - Each user can filter the tickets based on the priority level of Low, Medium, High, & Severe
3 - Organize tickets by filtering them based on categories. 
4 - Mark tickets as complete, but still reference them for records. 
5 - Comment on tickets bas
6 - Upon home view, users can view the most severe bugs that take priority for that day. 

To test this application, I have set up a fake profile. Feel free to use these creds and create/delete tickets to test the program: 
User - TestUser1
Pass - P@ssWord123

Features that would be great to add: 
1 - Pagination to help keep the number of tickets down for each page. 
2 - Seperate tickets by a project basis for each new project that the team has and keep tickets more organized. 
3 - Add indepth User Profiles for the Team and an Admin panel to assign tasks and see what task you have on deck as a user.
